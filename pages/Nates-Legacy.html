                                        through<br>a gradual, but dramatic metamorphosis. Alphaland was<br>about to

                                        probably the largest<br>swamp, too ever exist. The flora and fauna of

                                        time to adjust<br>to
                                        the dramatic changes that were taking place on<br>their World.<br>
                                        <br>The
                                        Alphaland Swamp was where
                                        a fish first used its<br>fins to crawl through shallow water. And where,
                                        when<br>cattails, ferns and
                                        other plants grew thick, and<br>stagnate land locked pools full of rotting
                                        vegetation<br>became the
                                        norm, oxygen starved fish survived by<br>gulping air at the water's surface.
                                        Until
                                        eventually,<br>more than one specie of these ancestral fish developed<br>lungs,
                                        which enabled them
                                        to breath out of water.<br>
                                        <br>And the Alphaland Swamp was also where, as the
                                        area<br>became higher
                                        and drier, that the fins of crawling fish<br>evolved into feet. Thereby allowing
                                        animals to
                                        pull<br>themselves from one shallow water hole to another.<br>And breathing,
                                        crawling animals,
                                        inhabited the land.<br>
                                        <br>Some of the ancient forms of lungfish, have
                                        changed<br>very little since
                                        they first evolved in Alpha Swamp,<br>and thrive in a variety of ecosystems
                                        today. Other<br>animals,
                                        which developed lungs, and four legs,<br>crawled from the swamp and rapidly
                                        evolved into a<br>myriad
                                        of different species. They became the<br>amphibians. And were the masters of
                                        their universe,<br>for
                                        the next eon.<br>
                                        <br>There is no doubt, most of the lands on Earth
                                        today,<br>except for the Ring
                                        Mountains, rose above the oceans<br>just before, or during the Amphibian Era.

                                        deal of water from
                                        the continents.<br>
                                        <br>Some continents, like Antarctica, actually gave up
                                        land<br>during this Era.
                                        The north edge of the Antarctic Plate<br>tilted down with the Atlantic-Indian
                                        Ocean and
                                        East<br>Indian Ocean Ridges, and allowed water to encroach upon<br>the
                                        Antarctica Continent. Africa
                                        tilted to the south<br>and east and ceded some land back to the ocean.
                                        South<br>America lost
                                        considerable area when it tilted down<br>toward the south and west. But on the
                                        total land
                                        mass<br>grew considerable during the Amphibian Era.<br>

                                        were at least<br>periodically globally in tack. And there was<br>sufficient
                                        inhabitable land
                                        bordering the entire Ring<br>Mountain Range that both flora and fauna were able

                                        found in Antarctica,
                                        boosting theories that the<br>continent was once linked to modern day America.
                                        Scientists<br>from
                                        the US and Argentina say the 70 million year old fossils<br>are the first of

                                        <br>The fossils were discovered early last week [note
                                        above<br>article date] on
                                        Vega Island south of Argentina on the<br>Antarctic Peninsula.<br>

                                        found part of a

                                        duck-billed<br>dinosaur. The creatures are similar to other finds in

                                        <br>One theory is

                                        moronic theory of
                                        Continental Drift was first hatched<br>back in the latter part of the nineteenth
                                        century,
                                        when<br>people noticed that the Eastern Coasts of North and South<br>America
                                        were vaguely congruent
                                        with the West Coasts of<br>Europe and Africa.<br>
                                        <br>Then in 1912, a German
                                        meteorologist named
                                        Alfred<br>Wegener [1880-1930] formally proposed that perhaps all<br>the Earth's
                                        land had once been
                                        connected into one<br>super-continent, which had been ripped apart, and
                                        was<br>now drifting asunder.
                                        But although Wegener argued<br>valiantly for his theory, he never saw it gain
                                        any<br>significant
                                        acceptance. The majority of scientists<br>steadfastly refused to even seriously
                                        consider
                                        the<br>theory for many years, because there simply was no<br>known mechanism
                                        powerful enough, to
                                        possibly be<br>accredited with shuffling continents around.<br>
                                        <br>Then in 1930,
                                        Arthur Holmes
                                        (1890-1965) suggested<br>that convectional currents, currents generated
                                        by<br>heat and thermal
                                        expansion within the Earth's mantle,<br>could possibly force the continents
                                        apart, or toward<br>one
                                        another. He further suggested that said touring<br>continents might be
                                        responsible for creating the
                                        ocean<br>floors and building mountain ranges while on their treks.<br>Though
                                        Holmes was already a
                                        widely respected geologist,<br>like Wegener, he saw little attention paid to his
                                        ideas.<br>
                                        <br>Floating continents was a hard sell to anyone, who had<br>any
                                        horse sense. And Holmes
                                        had warned that his ideas<br>were purely speculative and could have no
                                        scientific<br>value until
                                        they acquired solid support from<br>independent evidence. Nevertheless, his
                                        theory had<br>acquired a

                                        inherited. Yet, when they

                                        you suppose, had we

                                        through<br>our
                                        telescopes that we would still be agog with the<br>prospect of dinosaurs roaming
                                        around under the
                                        Venusian<br>clouds? Well, we need not argue a moot hypothetical, but,<br>if
                                        history means anything,
                                        people wanted to believe there<br>were dinosaurs on Venus, and habitually we
                                        would have<br>whole
                                        heartedly supported the belief, and passed it from<br>generation to generation,
                                        for hundreds of
                                        years, if it<br>had taken that long to disprove the theory.<br>
                                        <br>It is easy to
                                        equate the Theory
                                        of Continental Drift to<br>the Theory of Dinosaurs on Venus. Both rest, or
                                        rested<br>on a platform
                                        of assumptions. We have already dissected<br>and can clearly see the fatal flaws
                                        in the Theory
                                        of<br>Dinosaurs on Venus. For the most part it is the age old<br>story; of

                                        <br>The drilling
                                        crews found absolutely
                                        no collation<br>between the magnetic orientation of the ocean<br>floors, and the
                                        magnetic
                                        orientation of the cores<br>[samples] they retrieved from the holes they
                                        were<br>drilling. And
                                        neither did they find any magnetic<br>orientation continuity in the holes they
                                        drilled.<br>The
                                        magnetic orientation switched often and<br>haphazardly in every hole they

                                        spreading, actually proved the seafloors<br>are not spreading.<br>

                                        the end of the<br>Amphibian Era, scaly upstarts began appearing on the<br>scene.
                                        Unlike the
                                        amphibians these new animals could<br>comfortably spend hours out in the sun.
                                        Readily<br>leaving the
                                        water far behind, they could feed<br>anywhere they chose.<br>
                                        <br>Their only real
                                        need for water was
                                        to quench their<br>thirst. Their hard-shelled eggs were even enclosed<br>their

                                        environment, so they did not<br>need to be laid in the water.<br>
                                        <br>These scaly
                                        upstarts were the

                                        millions of years hence,<br>of you and I.<br>
                                        <br>Have you ever really pondered,
                                        how closely
                                        related<br>man is to the rest of the life on this old Earth?<br>
                                        <br>I find the
                                        facts are somewhat
                                        humbling, and totally<br>amazing. Yet, there is not one iota of doubt
                                        that;<br>such is the way the
                                        genes bounced.<br>
                                        <br>As the Atlantic and Indian Ocean basins settled,
                                        and<br>water kept steadily
                                        evaporating from the Sunny<br>Hemisphere and freezing into the form of the
                                        Glacier<br>Girdle. The
                                        water level, on the Sunny Hemisphere,<br>probably became hundreds of feet lower
                                        than the
                                        water<br>behind the Glacier Girdle, in the Pacific Ocean.<br>
                                        <br>And as the
                                        waters warmed, evolution
                                        undoubtedly<br>accelerated, dramatically. Though the warming water<br>may also
                                        brought about the
                                        extinction of some<br>species that had evolved, and lived for eons,<br>in cold
                                        water.<br>
                                        <br>The
                                        Glacier Girdle and Ring Mountains existed for<br>millions of years, effectively
                                        separating the
                                        warm<br>inviting waters of the Sunny Ocean from the frigid<br>waters of the
                                        Pacific.<br>
                                        <br>During
                                        those many millions of years that this<br>division of the oceans lasted, there
                                        were
                                        some<br>catastrophic breaches, which allowed ocean-like<br>quantities of frigid
                                        water to gush under
                                        the warm<br>waters of the Sunny Hemisphere.<br>
                                        <br>Such intrusions undoubtedly
                                        caused the death
                                        of<br>countless animals, and likewise killed many plants.<br>On some occasions
                                        whole species were
                                        extinguished,<br>in other cases such sudden cooling of the oceans may<br>have
                                        been the prime
                                        instigator of more than one<br>mass extinctions. &nbsp;<br>
                                        <br>As the Amphibian
                                        Era came to a close,
                                        the<br>amphibian's reign, as rulers of the World, may have<br>been hastened by

                                        <br>One thing is an indubitable fact,

                                        largest animals to ever walk upon out Earth.<br>
                                        <br>Dinosaurs, the magnificent

                                        hundred and sixty<br>million years. The only equals the mightiest of

                                        of their own kind. They evolved<br>into thousands of different species, and at
                                        least<br>periodically
                                        inhabited every continent on Earth.<br>The predators dined on everything from

                                        to<br>brontosaurus.<br>
                                        <br>The herbivores munched on a wide variety of
                                        flora,<br>ranging from moss
                                        and grass, to leaves and twigs<br>plucked from tall trees. They adapted to

                                        niche and expanse in their environment<br>that the present-day mammals have

                                        Dinosaurs were hardy, adaptable and great<br>survivors. They deserve our awe and

                                        <br>The dinosaurs occupied a much different world than<br>we

                                        their world was bathed<br>in continuous Sunlight. But the site of the
                                        North<br>and South Polar Axes,
                                        probably only annually, saw<br>the Sun rise over the horizon but a short
                                        way,<br>less than sixty
                                        degrees, before it started to<br>descend again. The rest of the year was spent
                                        in<br>a waning
                                        twilight and falling temperatures,<br>forecasting the impeding cold, dark
                                        winter.<br>
                                        <br>After two
                                        or three months of total darkness, the<br>horizon would once again show a hint
                                        of light.<br>The
                                        temperature would then begin to rise as light<br>slowly flooded the area, long
                                        before the
                                        Sun<br>actually appeared over the horizon, to usher in<br>another summer. Under
                                        these conditions
                                        was, when<br>and where, nearly all the plants that we know<br>today
                                        originated.<br>

                                        learned to flower, produce their seeds<br>and drop them quickly, that they might
                                        extend<br>their
                                        species through the coming winter.<br>Perennials evolved and honed the ability
                                        to<br>anticipate the
                                        coming winter, drop its leaves,<br>and let the moisture drain from its trunks
                                        or<br>stem and limbs,
                                        and descend down deep into its<br>roots. &nbsp;It learned to become dormant. To
                                        survive<br>the
                                        winter by playing dead, only to miraculously<br>sprout new leaves and burst into
                                        bloom, with
                                        the<br>arrival of spring.<br>
                                        <br>But the areas around the North and South Polar
                                        Axis<br>were not the
                                        only areas on primitive Earth, where<br>life established thriving, biologically
                                        diverse<br>communities. Outside the reach of any [or at least<br>any continuous]

                                        sunrays.<br>
                                        <br>Antarctica, Australia, Eurasia, North America and<br>South
                                        America all had large
                                        tracks of land that<br>perpetually remained in the twilight. All also
                                        had<br>lands that only
                                        seasonally received some direct<br>sunlight, and remained in the twilight for
                                        the rest<br>of the
                                        year. Some of these areas, for example, the<br>strip of land that reaches from
                                        Northern Mexico
                                        up<br>through Montana and North Dakota, were among the most<br>biologically
                                        productive areas on
                                        Earth. The oil and<br>coal reserves in this strip pay mute testimony to<br>that
                                        fact. Yet this area
                                        was well within a twilight<br>zone throughout the entire Dinosaur Era.<br>
                                        <br>Of
                                        course we all know
                                        that flora flourishes<br>under the canopy of a rain forest. That many
                                        plants<br>actually prefer
                                        indirect light. Yet, frankly it was<br>a bit unsettling to have to conclude that
                                        ninety<br>percent
                                        of the fossils, of flora and fauna, that I<br>saw in my life, lived and died in
                                        a twilight
                                        zone.<br>
                                        <br>A lot about such an environment matches the
                                        known<br>characteristics of the era's
                                        flora. The giant ferns,<br>the incredible height that some of the
                                        relatively<br>small trees reached,
                                        the huge cattails, and over<br>sized leaves of other plants, all point toward
                                        the<br>probability
                                        that these plants grew in an environment<br>with little or no direct sunlight.
                                        It is
                                        almost<br>certain that such plants did not grew in any<br>environment sporting
                                        continuous direct

                                        <br>If the clouds during the Dinosaur Era naturally<br>moved away
                                        from the center of
                                        the Sunny Hemisphere,<br>and slowed as they spread out like anything
                                        moving<br>centrifugally does,
                                        then the skies of all the<br>twilight zones around the World were probably
                                        all<br>partly cloudy, to
                                        mostly cloudy, most of the time.<br>If such was the reality, the sun shining
                                        over the<br>horizon and
                                        reflecting off of those clouds, could<br>have very easily doubled, or perhaps
                                        even tripled<br>the
                                        amount of light, that would normally have been<br>reflected off the water and
                                        emerging continents.
                                        A<br>cloud cover would also have competently conserved<br>the heat, which moved
                                        continuously from
                                        the Sunny<br>Hemisphere, to the Twilight Zone.<br>

                                        the Sunny Hemisphere
                                        must<br>have been a strange, eerie world. Whether or not,<br>an area at the edge
                                        of Sunny Hemisphere
                                        received<br>some direct sunlight, or lay just beyond the reach<br>of the Sun's
                                        rays, the plants,
                                        including the trees,<br>would surely have grown/leaned sharply toward
                                        the<br>light. We may have to
                                        adjust our concept of light<br>boned rangy animals scampering around on the
                                        forest<br>floors, to an
                                        expanded arboreal existence.<br>
                                        <br>Imagining such animals chasing each another

                                        through the tops of leaning trees, and<br>remembering that some of these animals
                                        developed<br>something that at least resembled feathers, it is not<br>hard to
                                        accept that gliding,
                                        or even true flight<br>about had to be an evolutionary possibility.
                                        In<br>retrospect, some may
                                        think, it logically appears<br>obtaining the ability to fly was more like,
                                        a<br>probability. The
                                        animals that occupied the Earth,<br>during the Dinosaur Era, had a long, long
                                        time to<br>acquire and
                                        hone new evolutionary abilities.<br>
                                        <br>There is a problem, with asserting that
                                        crustal
                                        plates<br>tilted down to the oceanic ridges, and created the<br>Sunny
                                        Hemisphere's ocean basins. Any
                                        sphere, including<br>the Earth's crust, holds a finite amount of matter.<br>And
                                        if we maintain dents
                                        are developing on a sphere's<br>surface, then we must account for where the
                                        matter went,<br>which
                                        those dents displaced.<br>
                                        <br>When the Glacier Girdle pushed land from the
                                        center of<br>the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere, the floor of the Pacific Ocean<br>behind the Glacier Girdle was left
                                        far
                                        below<br>gravitational/spherical balance. To put it in the<br>simplest terms, as
                                        the force of
                                        gravity increased on the<br>crust of the Earth, as it emerged from the Sunlit
                                        Ocean,<br>the
                                        pressures increased proportionally inside the<br>Earth's Crust on the opposite
                                        side of the
                                        World.<br>
                                        <br>You would think, since the ocean floors are obviously<br>the
                                        lowest points on the
                                        Earth's surface, that any<br>untenable internal pressures built up in the
                                        Earth's<br>crust, would be
                                        ejected out upon the ocean floors.<br>Obviously that is not what usually
                                        happens. Instead it<br>is
                                        more ordinary to see the top blow off some mountain<br>that is thousands of
                                        yards [several
                                        kilometers] high<br>and often within a few hundred miles [or kilometers]<br>of
                                        the ocean.<br>
                                        <br>The
                                        pressure it takes to force magma up thousands of<br>yards/meters through the
                                        interior of a mountain,
                                        and<br>then blow the top off of that mountain, is almost<br>incalculable. But
                                        one thing is for sure:
                                        The pressure<br>is far greater a hundred miles away, a couple
                                        thousand<br>yards/meters below
                                        sea-level on the ocean floor.<br>
                                        <br>The primary reason magma seldom escapes on
                                        the ocean<br>floors
                                        is; when magma tries to escape up through a<br>fissure and comes into contact
                                        with water, it
                                        is<br>almost instantly cooled. It is like dropping a<br>red-hot horseshoe in a
                                        bucket of cold water.
                                        In two<br>minutes you can handle such a horseshoe with your bare<br>hands. Magma
                                        that comes into
                                        direct contact with cold<br>water, usually violently bursts, into tiny
                                        pieces.<br>
                                        <br>Only after the
                                        water surrounding the magma gets hot<br>enough, and/or sufficient shattered
                                        debris accumulates<br>to

                                        set up. Eventually
                                        magma<br>nearly always solidifies and effectively keeps the<br>fissures in the
                                        ocean floors, at
                                        least temporarily,<br>sealed.<br>

                                        to relieve that
                                        pressure.<br>Some times the plug, the newly solidified magma that<br>sealed the
                                        fissure, is the
                                        weakest lank, and gets<br>violently removed, in an undersea eruption.
                                        Such<br>eruptions are common
                                        along oceanic fissures.<br>
                                        <br>They very greatly in intensity and can eject a
                                        great<br>deal, or very
                                        little of the fissure walls, along with<br>the plug. The largest eruptions
                                        create giant
                                        tsunamis<br>that ravage beaches, hundreds of kilometers/miles
                                        away.<br>Eventually the water manages
                                        to cool and bring even the<br>most violent eruptions under control. And the
                                        fissure<br>is resealed,
                                        with a little larger plug.<br>
                                        <br>Where the plug is strong enough, and remains
                                        in place<br>long
                                        enough, the pressure is often relieved by a route<br>that avoids the
                                        antithetical clashes of water
                                        and magma.<br>The pressure of the magma instead forces a
                                        subterranean<br>intrusion between the
                                        strata that constitutes the ocean<br>floor.<br>
                                        <br>Magma usually intrudes deep
                                        enough below the
                                        ocean<br>floor, that some of the water has been squeezed out of<br>the
                                        formations where it
                                        encroaches. Sealed from direct<br>contact with water and blanketed against heat

                                        strata above, the intruding magma may flow for<br>years and cover huge areas. It
                                        should be noted
                                        that<br>once the formations above the magma have been broken<br>loose and
                                        lifted, it takes little or
                                        no pressure to<br>hold them up. The magma is heavier than the formations.<br>The
                                        lifted stratum
                                        literally floats upon the magma.<br>
                                        <br>The magma, which had to move to allow
                                        the oceans
                                        basins<br>on the Sunny Hemisphere to sink, caused a like quantity<br>of magma to
                                        intrude
                                        subterraneously between the strata<br>on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. The
                                        evidence of<br>these
                                        intrusions remains obvious today, even though<br>the Pacific Ocean has under
                                        gone some dramatic
                                        changes<br>since the Dinosaur Era ended. The thousands of sea<br>mounts on the

                                        Ocean offers<br>us a hint of where the magma may have gone.<br>

                                        Era, the Magnetic<br>North and South Poles were on the Equator, on

                                        were close, but were not<br>located on, the present day Equator. The
                                        North<br>Magnetic Pole was
                                        situated at about ten degrees<br>South, and fifty-five degrees west, very

                                        twenty-five degrees<br>East. The North Magnetic Pole may have drifted<br>[what

                                        any<br>appreciable amount before they started to drift,<br>toward the Polar
                                        Rotational Axis. Before
                                        the Earth<br>started rotating once a day, the Earth's magnetic<br>field may have
                                        had a much more
                                        stable guidance<br>system than it has today.<br>
                                        <br>It appears that most
                                        scientists believe that

                                        Obviously the height of the Glaciers Girdle was<br>dictated by the rate

                                        amphibians<br>crawled from the Sunny Ocean.<br>
                                        <br>As explained in the

                                        accomplished.
                                        The<br>Glacier Girdle shifted the Earth's center of gravity,<br>until the ocean
                                        floor was elevated

                                        the simple phenomena in<br>the allegory, it should, would, lie in the form of
                                        a<br>near-perfect

                                        <br>The explanation is simple: The primeval Earth's

                                        was tilted, relative to its orbital plane. You<br>may further note, on a Globe,

                                        north,<br>continuing along the

                                        <br>We can ascertain
                                        much more from the
                                        shape of the Pacific<br>Oceans. The amount the intersecting circles
                                        overlap<br>indicates the degree
                                        the primitive Earth's Axis was<br>tilted, relative to its orbital plane. Let me
                                        suggest<br>you get
                                        yourself a &nbsp;globe, and as near as possible,<br>reconstruct these geometric
                                        drawings.<br>
                                        <br>From the position of the overlapping circles, we
                                        can<br>calculate, that the Earth's
                                        Axis was tilted during early<br>Earth History at slightly less of an angle,
                                        relative to<br>our Sun,
                                        than it is today. Or, more precisely, it appears<br>the Earths Axis was
                                        originally tilted, a bit
                                        more than 19<br>degrees. Which of course, is somewhat less than 23.5<br>degrees,
                                        the Earth's present
                                        orbit inclination. It may<br>well be that our planets inclination has
                                        remained<br>unchanged, the
                                        annual winter and summer at the Axis<br>Poles, may have just failed to situate
                                        the Glacier
                                        Girdle,<br>to perfectly indicate the exact degree of inclination.<br>
                                        <br>You may
                                        have noticed, on
                                        the North American Continent,<br>the Pacific Ocean no longer extends to the edge
                                        of the<br>North
                                        Pacific circle. Nevertheless be assured that<br>throughout most of Earth History
                                        the Pacific Ice Cap
                                        did<br>extend to a position, just west of the Rocky Mountains.<br>Only after the
                                        weight of the
                                        Glacier Girdle, by tilting<br>the crustal plates, began to modify the shape of
                                        the<br>Earth, did
                                        that portion of the Glacier Girdle covering<br>Western America
                                        recede.<br>
                                        <br>The Pacific coastal
                                        mountains, and oceanic trenches,<br>mutely testify to a later phenomenon. That
                                        the Glacier<br>Girdle
                                        did grow to near its original magnificence, in a<br>new location, one

                                        can<br>justifiably only be called
                                        mountains, when we ponder<br>their magnitude setting upon the ocean floor. The
                                        Ring<br>Mountains
                                        continuously grew wider and wider, and sloped<br>ever more slowly as they
                                        extended further and
                                        further into<br>the Sunny Ocean. But, the Ring Mountains never extended<br>but a
                                        few feet above the
                                        surface of the Sunny Ocean<br>while the Glacier Girdle existed.<br>
                                        <br>Once
                                        portions of the Ring
                                        Mountains emerged, grew above sea<br>level, avalanches and glacier flows, no

                                        check<br>by the warm waters of the Sunny Ocean, would move across<br>those
                                        exposed crests,
                                        continuously leveling them. The<br>incredible quantities of Water escaping from

                                        Girdle also tended to hold the height of the Ring<br>Mountains in check by
                                        continuously washing
                                        across them<br>wherever and whenever they become exposed.<br>
                                        <br>Remnants of the
                                        Ring Mountains have
                                        been found in many<br>locations. And those locations do roughly encircle
                                        the<br>Pacific Ocean. But
                                        said remnants have often been<br>erroneously identified, usually as the exposed
                                        roots of<br>ancient
                                        mountain ranges, supposedly similar to those we<br>know today, which have been
                                        eroded away. The

                                        viable science. Even

                                        <br>Yes, many of
                                        us have seen where a crustal plate appears<br>to have shifted horizontally
                                        relative to an adjacent
                                        plate.<br>Please let me assure you that it was only a relatively<br>small chuck
                                        of some of the upper
                                        strata on the plate that<br>actually shifted. Crustal Plates are hundreds of
                                        miles<br>thick, and do
                                        not shift horizontally, or vertically,<br>relative to the other.<br>
                                        <br>There is
                                        but one defined
                                        force within the realm of true<br>physics, capable of so deforming Earth that
                                        the crust on<br>our
                                        planet would crack. One force powerful enough to move,<br>tilt, a crustal plate
                                        and that force is
                                        gravity. And<br>gravity, directed by the accretion and then melting of
                                        the<br>Glacier Girdle, is the
                                        godlike force singularly<br>responsible for the present shape of our
                                        Earth.<br>
                                        <br>To conclude that
                                        some alternative undefined infinite force<br>is responsible for reshaping of our
                                        Earth, is but to
                                        invoke<br>mysticism, in lieu of logic. No defined force, no observable,<br>or
                                        otherwise detectable,
                                        credible mechanism has ever been<br>postulated, that could motivate continental
                                        drift.<br>
                                        <br>Now,
                                        I'm quite sure that you all have heard that ageless<br>proverb which teaches;
                                        when it waddles like a
                                        duck, quacks<br>like a duck, and as in this case, even smells a bit like
                                        a<br>fish fed duck, then
                                        you are safe in assuming, that it is,<br>in fact, a duck.<br>
                                        <br>Well, any
                                        infinite, intangible
                                        force, accessible only via<br>verbal projection, is similar to nothing but the
                                        Gods,<br>past and
                                        present. Genuine logicians do not believe in<br>Gods or Devils, neither animate
                                        nor inanimate. And
                                        this<br>simple summation should incite grave ambivalence in any<br>truly
                                        objective scientist, whom
                                        has heretofore believed<br>in the Theory of Continental Drift.<br>
                                        <br>I wish it
                                        could be that easy.
                                        Surely the most formidable<br>task any man could charge himself with is that of
                                        reasoning<br>away a

                                        Devil. Any educated
                                        person would know<br>that history proves it, utter folly, to even attempt
                                        such<br>an

                                        <br>The illustrious, Harold Jeffreys, began expressing
                                        his<br>opposition to the Theory
                                        of Continental Drift, and pointing<br>out to his learned colleagues, that the
                                        force of
                                        gravity<br>was by far, the mightiest force exerted upon the crust of<br>the
                                        Earth, ten years before
                                        I was born. But alas, alas, his<br>efforts were all to no avail. Even though,
                                        Sir Jeffreys was<br>a
                                        World renowned, knighted astronomer, methodist of<br>mathematical physics and

                                        sufficient prevalence, to render it capable of<br>lowering, the light end of an

                                        teeter-totter.<br>
                                        <br>Remember, what Archimedes boasted? 'Give me a lever

                                        World.'<br>
                                        <br>Obviously, the force of
                                        gravity acting upon the light<br>end of the aforementioned teeter-totter is more
                                        than<br>equaled by
                                        the opposing force of gravity acting upon the<br>heavy end of the teeter-totter.
                                        Physically, a force
                                        equal<br>to the weight of the light end of the teeter-totter is<br>oppositely

                                        teeter-totter board, or<br>lever, from the heavy end to the light end of
                                        the<br>teeter-totter.
                                        Similarly, in as simple a manner,<br>leverage is the prime motivating medium of
                                        all
                                        orogenic<br>forces. And therefore, understanding the awesome<br>potential of
                                        leverage is an
                                        elementary prerequisite<br>to comprehending the true physics of plate
                                        tectonics.<br>
                                        <br>Actually, if
                                        you were to float a plank in a bath tub<br>(lets say a plank that measures 2X
                                        thick, by 6X
                                        wide,<br>by 36X long) and then you were to tack a piece of 1X<br>quarter-round,
                                        6X long, along the
                                        edge on one end of<br>that plank, you would note that the quarter-round
                                        would<br>have little effect
                                        upon the plank, or upon the level at<br>which the plank floated. A rather
                                        childish
                                        experiment,<br>don't you agree? But it does demonstrate,
                                        comparatively<br>speaking, just about how
                                        much effect a mountain range<br>has upon the crustal plate it edges.<br>
                                        <br>Now,
                                        on the other hand,
                                        if you were to place a 5X beaker<br>on the other end of our plank and began
                                        filling it with<br>ice,
                                        you would soon note the effect. Not only would the<br>end with the beaker on it
                                        begin to submerge,
                                        but almost<br>magically the other end of the board would begin to rise.<br>Of
                                        course it is because,
                                        like the teeter-totter, the<br>force of gravity upon the added weight, ice, is
                                        oppositely<br>transposed along the lever, or board. Crustal plates<br>on our
                                        sphere, floating on a
                                        molten interior, respond<br>to the same laws of physics, as did the board in
                                        our<br>allegoric
                                        bathtub. There is but insignificant differences.<br>Think about it: The water in
                                        our bathtub was but
                                        a minute<br>portion, of the same sphere. The water in the tub even<br>arcs
                                        congruently, to the
                                        descending horizons of an ocean.<br>Granted there are many other pertinent
                                        factors that must<br>be
                                        considered, if we are to clearly understand what has<br>taken place on Earth.
                                        But no mysterious
                                        phenomenon, or forces,<br>nothing incomprehensible to the common-intellect has
                                        ever<br>played a role
                                        in forming the surface features of our planet.<br soft="">

                                        multiplied like rats in a granary.<br>There was, in a very short time on an

                                        began to slowly descend upon the<br>weaning Aqua Era.<br>

                                        should be added if I dare, (forgive me ladies) the<br>Glacier Girdle moved mass
                                        much more
                                        effectively and<br>permanently, than did the whalebone corsets worn by<br>those
                                        aristocratic
                                        belles.<br>
                                        <br>The Glacier Girdle was solely responsible for<br>routing and
                                        washing the rock flour
                                        from the primeval<br>Earth's crust, which now constitutes much of
                                        the<br>continental shields. And by
                                        directing the subterraneous<br>intrusion of superheated water and molten magma
                                        into<br>the Ring
                                        Mountains, and adjoining primitive strata, the<br>Glacier Girdle was indirectly
                                        responsible for
                                        leaching<br>and separating the various elements derived from<br>that rock
                                        flour.<br>

                                        Girdle wrought a great deal more. As said<br>it was the Glacier Girdle which so
                                        shifted the
                                        Earth's<br>center of gravity that the sea-floor, the first land,<br>slowly
                                        emerged from the center
                                        of the Sunlit Ocean.<br>
                                        <br>As central east Africa, the area surrounding the
                                        original<br>site of the
                                        South Magnetic Pole, rose to emerge from the<br>Sunlit Ocean, the force of
                                        gravity
                                        magnified<br>proportionally, in its effort to maintain the Earth's<br>spherical
                                        form. And it was
                                        when those Crustal Plates began<br>tilting in compliance with gravity's
                                        spherical

                                        to<br>take shape. &nbsp;Since
                                        the Pacific Ocean was much narrower,<br>east to west, than the distance across
                                        the
                                        Sunny<br>Hemisphere, the Glacier Girdles probably oppositely<br>transposed
                                        sufficient pressures to
                                        form an apex in the<br>center of the Pacific Ocean and create one of the
                                        first<br>great fissures,
                                        which were to slowly encircle the globe.<br>
                                        <br>The great fissure that separated
                                        Africa from Europe
                                        was<br>undoubtedly one of the first, if not the first crack to<br>appear on the
                                        Sunny Hemisphere.
                                        The shifting<br>gravitational attraction of the Sun, as the
                                        Earth<br>continuously tilted on its
                                        axis, from winter to summer<br>and back to winter, probably accelerated that
                                        rifting.<br>
                                        <br>At this
                                        late date there is little evidence left of some<br>of the fissures that played a
                                        major roll in
                                        initiating<br>the crustal plates tilting that helped shape our<br>continents.
                                        Look at Antarctica.
                                        Maps of the Earth's<br>ocean floors clearly show the rifts that
                                        circled<br>Antarctica. But there is
                                        no sign of the &nbsp;great rift that<br>ripped the continent apart, as it's
                                        edges tilted
                                        down<br>with the subsiding Atlantic-Indian Ocean and East<br>Indian Ocean
                                        Ridges. It is obvious that
                                        the rift is<br>there, and was very active, it divided the continent.<br>Now,
                                        only a hot lake in a
                                        frigid country, a wisp<br>of smoke from a volcanic mountain, and a few
                                        other<br>similar hints,
                                        reminds us that a great crack still<br>lurks under the glaciers. A great many of
                                        the cracks<br>in
                                        the Earth's crust, which allowed crustal plates to<br>tilt down to the ocean's
                                        ridges, have never
                                        been found,<br>much less documented, mapped. For example: The Owen<br>fracture
                                        Zone extends on
                                        between Africa and Madagascar,<br>to the Prince Edwards Fracture Zone.
                                        This<br>Africa/Madagascar
                                        Fracture allowed The Madagascar<br>Plate to pull away from Africa, as the East
                                        side of<br>the plate
                                        subsided with the Indian Ocean Ridge.<br>
                                        <br>To explain the tilting of crustal
                                        plates, let
                                        us<br>focus our attention on North America. In-The-Beginning,<br>the Glacier
                                        Girdle that accreted in
                                        the area we<br>now call North America, was situated just westerly<br>adjacent of
                                        what is now the
                                        Rocky Mountains. [</span>

                                        that the Glacier Girdle did remain<br>at this location for millions of years,

                                        only inches per year, at most but a few feet.<br>Therefore it probably took not

                                        is now the<br>west coast of North America.<br>
                                        <br>But, what could cause
                                        thousands of feet,

                                        begin to melt? It was<br>most likely a combination of events, all of
                                        which<br>were the result of
                                        tilting crustal plates.<br>
                                        <br>On the world that I have described, all lines

                                        force of gravity attempting to<br>flatten the Earth as it emerged from the
                                        depths,<br>on the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere would have radiated from<br>the original site of the South Magnetic

                                        out in a complete circle, to the Glacier<br>Girdle. And likewise, the lines of
                                        force,
                                        weight<br>oppositely transposed, from the Glacier Girdle<br>would have all
                                        pointed inwardly, toward
                                        the South<br>Magnetic pole. Where these two powerful oppositely<br>transposed
                                        forces met, at what is
                                        now the Mid-Atlantic<br>Ridge, they caused the Earth's Crust to apex.
                                        Actually<br>rock formations
                                        bend very little before they break. The<br>combined forces bent the crust, and
                                        the rock
                                        cracked.<br>
                                        <br>Once the integrity of the Crust was violated, the
                                        Glacier<br>Girdle was tilting a
                                        crustal plate that reach from the<br>Rocky Mountains to the mid Atlantic, about
                                        3,000
                                        miles<br>[4,850 kilometers]of plate. Remember the plank and beaker<br>full of
                                        ice. That would be
                                        like submerging the end of a<br>40 foot plank. Something would have to give, and
                                        it<br>did, the
                                        crust fissured along the Appalachian Mountains,<br>the coast of Africa and
                                        Europe, and allowed
                                        the<br>Mid-Atlantic Ridge to settle. &nbsp;<br>
                                        <br>As the Atlantic Ocean basin
                                        subsided, it drained
                                        an<br>ocean of water from the land, lowered the horizon,<br>and exposed millions
                                        of acres of land
                                        that had been<br>covered by water, to a never setting Sun. At the<br>same time
                                        the Appalachian
                                        Mountains were slowly rising,<br>higher into the eternal sun, and collecting
                                        more solar<br>heat.
                                        Eventually water and atmosphere may have both<br>circulated around the
                                        Appalachian Mountains,
                                        and<br>expedited the Glacier Girdle's receding.<br>The coal mines paralleling

                                        and was teeming with aqua life, rose slowly to<br>meet the placid surface of the

                                        the Sunny Hemisphere and adapted<br>to absorb sunlit directly. Those first
                                        surface plants<br>had
                                        many advantages over their ancestor's strictly aqua<br>existence. One of the

                                        was an unlimited supply of sunlit.<br>Once hardy plants were growing above the

                                        one small evolutionary step, to step out onto dry<br>ground. Of course many of

                                        evolved<br>in those shallow sunlit waters survived by moving into<br>deeper
                                        water around the
                                        perimeter of the emerging land<br>and lived on to eventually spread worldwide.

                                        surface of the water, to the<br>Sunny Hemisphere.<br>
                                        <br>Subsequently, an almost
                                        perfect atmospheric
                                        circulating<br>system, was established. Wherein there were massive<br>quantities
                                        of warm, moist air
                                        in the upper atmosphere<br>flowing away from the Sunny Hemisphere to the cold,

                                        Earth. Where cooling it dropped its moisture,<br>before returning cool and dry
                                        to the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere.<br>
                                        <br>Throughout the billions of years that elapsed between,
                                        the<br>eon before Earth's
                                        first living-cell divided, until just<br>minutes before the last dinosaurs died,
                                        an
                                        atmospheric<br>circulation mode, basically as depicted, endured.<br>
                                        <br>The
                                        Endless Ocean also
                                        circulated in a mode, very similar<br>to the way the atmosphere circulated.
                                        Great quantities
                                        of<br>water around the central section of the Sunny Hemisphere,<br>heated by the
                                        tireless
                                        &nbsp;Sun's rays expanded, became lighter,<br>and spread centrifugally over the
                                        more dense,
                                        heavier,<br>waters of the cold, Dark Hemisphere. And also like
                                        the<br>atmosphere, the frigid water
                                        of the Dark Hemisphere<br>steadily flowed back under the warmer water on the
                                        Sunny<br>Hemisphere.
                                        And thereby completed an almost perfect<br>oceanic circulating system, for
                                        primitive
                                        Earth.<br>
                                        <br>But, massive clouds continuously formed on the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere.<br>In fact, clouds
                                        actually controlled the temperature on the Sunny <br soft="">Hemisphere. And in
                                        so doing,
                                        undoubtedly accelerated the growth<br>of the Pacific Ice Cap, as it spread
                                        across the Dark
                                        Hemisphere.<br>To elucidate, the Sun shining continuously upon the waters of the
                                        <br soft="">Sunny
                                        Hemisphere, steadily raised the temperature of that water,<br>until the waters
                                        reach a temperature
                                        where great quantities<br>of it evaporated.<br>
                                        <br>With those great quantities
                                        of evaporated water,
                                        moisture<br>in the air, massive clouds formed to shade the water and
                                        reflect<br>the searing sunrays
                                        back into space. So shaded, the slowly circulating <br soft="">water, cooling,
                                        would then begin to
                                        evaporate more<br>slowly. And thereby, generate less cloud cover, and again
                                        let<br>through more
                                        sunrays, which would again raise the temperature<br>of the water. In this way,
                                        clouds rigidly
                                        regulated the<br>temperature on the Sunny Hemisphere.<br>
                                        <br>To reiterate, the
                                        primeval Earth had an
                                        almost perfect, atmospheric <br soft="">circulating system. Except for the fact
                                        that the
                                        aforementioned <br soft="">temperature-regulating phenomenon did not allow the
                                        Sunny Hemisphere <br soft="">to absorb the massive quantities of heat that would
                                        have been <br soft="">necessary to
                                        keep the Dark Hemisphere warm, above that temperature<br>at which water freezes.
                                        And so it was, that
                                        from In-the-beginning,<br>the temperature on the Dark Hemisphere steadily fell,
                                        and the ice<br>cap
                                        on the Dark Hemisphere steadily grew. Until eventually, ice<br>covered the
                                        entire area now encircled
                                        by, that which is often<br>referred to as, The Ring of Fire, until the Pacific
                                        Ice Cap<br>of the
                                        Dark Hemisphere became transpacific in scope.<br>

                                        the outer edge of the<br>Pacific Ice Cap, great quantities of it began to
                                        accumulate,<br>compress
                                        under its own weight, and form more ice. That ice,<br>as it grew thicker and
                                        thicker, by continued
                                        accretion,<br>became the first icebergs on Earth. As those bergs

                                        of ice, was but one
                                        long, endless<br>ice berg circling the globe and resting upon the ocean
                                        floor.<br>It may sound

                                        Ocean, the
                                        so-called<br>"Ring of Fire" could have once far more appropriately<br>been
                                        dubbed, 'The Ring of
                                        Ice.'<br>
                                        <br>The warm moist atmosphere never intruded far over the
                                        frigid<br>Pacific Ice Cap. Over
                                        90 percent of all the snow that fell on <br soft="">Primitive Earth probably
                                        fell in a belt, seldom
                                        over a<br>thousand miles wide. And as that ring of ice grew higher and<br>higher
                                        above sealevel, it
                                        set heavier and heavier upon the<br>ocean floor. Until eventually the
                                        ever-thickening ice towered
                                        <br soft="">thousands of feet above the surface of the Endless Ocean,
                                        and<br>spread, flowed at its
                                        base, under that great weight,<br>as all glaciers flow.<br>
                                        <br>The ice-belt,
                                        oceanic glaciers, had
                                        faults, or cracks in<br>it where the various sections had settled and/or spread
                                        at<br>different
                                        rates. As the oceanic glaciers spread at their<br>bases, much that spread toward
                                        the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere<br>melted as it extended into the warm circulating water.<br>While
                                        the ice that spread
                                        into the frigid waters of the<br>Pacific Ocean melted much more slowly, and
                                        spread as weight<br>and
                                        time dictated. Hence, the Glacier Girdle was shaped<br>more like a right
                                        trapezium, with its
                                        most-perpendicular<br>side facing the Sun, than like an isosceles trapezoid,
                                        as<br>would a girdling

                                        equal.<br>
                                        <br>From the moment ice first touched the ocean floor, two<br>physical
                                        phenomena commenced
                                        functioning, that would<br>forever change the landless, Endless Ocean. As
                                        mentioned,<br>the Oceanic
                                        Glaciers flowed at their bases, much as<br>continental glaciers flow. Except
                                        that the
                                        'Glacier<br>Girdle' continued for many, many years to accumulate<br>snow, grow
                                        steadily heavier, and
                                        extend its base,<br>across the ocean floor. And as the Glacier Girdle
                                        spread,<br>it bulldozed great
                                        quantities of oceanic sediment along<br>ahead of the moving ice.<br>
                                        <br>The
                                        second, and most
                                        important, phenomenon to commence<br>functioning was that, as ice set upon the
                                        subterraneously<br>heated ocean floor, it melted. The resulting water
                                        under<br>the oceanic glaciers
                                        was under an unbelievable pressure,<br>thousands of pounds per square inch. And
                                        as it vented,<br>it
                                        carried with it, not only any sediment that the<br>bulldozing action of the
                                        spreading Glacier Girdle
                                        had<br>missed, but also continuously washed out, eroded, tiny<br>granules of the
                                        crust from under
                                        the Glacier Girdle.<br>
                                        <br>The first land to break the surface of the Endless
                                        Ocean<br>was a blend
                                        of the aforementioned sediment bulldozed up by<br>the Glacier Girdle and minute
                                        particles of
                                        primeval crust,<br>washed from under the glaciers. In the twilight of
                                        the<br>Sunny Hemisphere, many
                                        small islands, always dwarfed by<br>the massive oceanic glaciers they
                                        paralleled, were
                                        pushed<br>above the surface of the Endless Ocean, only to be washed<br>away,
                                        again and again. And
                                        the tiny islands that appeared<br>and vanished with such regularity were but

                                        the mighty, endless mountain range that steadily grew,<br>beneath the surface of
                                        the Endless Ocean,
                                        at the<br>foot of the Glacier Girdle.<br>
                                        <br>The tiny portions of the oceanic
                                        crust washed from
                                        under<br>the Glacier Girdle, and the original oceanic sediment was<br>for the
                                        most part, very fine
                                        grained, predominantly<br>microscopic particles. And much of it, once disturbed,
                                        was<br>carried away
                                        by circulating ocean currents, and deposited<br>far from the Glacier Girdle, was
                                        spread across the
                                        Sunny<br>Hemisphere. And so, the most primitive strata, resulting<br>solely from

                                        phenomena, were deposited.<br>Strata, for the most part consisting of
                                        fine-grained
                                        sand,<br>deposited upon the most primitive strata pays mute evidence<br>to the
                                        endless mountain
                                        range, which paralleled the Glacier<br>Girdle. For that fine-grained sand was
                                        the product,
                                        of<br>phenomena relative to that mountain range which<br>circled the
                                        Earth.<br>
                                        <br>In spite of the
                                        fact that the endless mountain range that<br>ringed the Earth, was in a climatic
                                        zone where it
                                        rained<br>or/and snowed, continuously, it slowly but steadily emerged<br>from
                                        the Endless Ocean.
                                        Until eventually, it became a<br>permanent divider, an unbroken mountain ring,
                                        between the<br>frigid
                                        water of the Pacific Ocean, and the warm inviting<br>waters of the Sunny
                                        Hemisphere. And in accord
                                        with 'Genesis'<br>account of creation, the Earth's waters were parted.<br>And
                                        the endless ocean was,

                                        earth's magnetic field is believed to originate from electric<br>currents in the
                                        core. It is a
                                        well-known law in physics that a<br>moving current creates a magnetic field, and
                                        conversely, a
                                        current<br>is induced into a conductor moving in a magnetic field.
                                        Electrical<br>currents in the
                                        core could start in a number of ways, such as<br>through a weak battery action
                                        caused by
                                        compositional differences.<br>Once started, these currents could be amplified by
                                        a dynamo
                                        action<br>in the Earth's core.<br>
                                        <br>A dynamo produces electric current by
                                        moving a conductor in
                                        a<br>magnetic field. In the earth the core is the conductor, and<br>because it
                                        is fluid, it can
                                        move. The mechanism envisioned is<br>similar to a dynamo, which produces an
                                        electric current,
                                        and<br>this current is fed to an electric motor that drives the
                                        dynamo.<br>
                                        <br>Friction and
                                        electrical resistance would prevent such a perpetual<br>motion machine from
                                        continuing to operate
                                        unless more energy is<br>added. In the earth this additional energy can come
                                        from movement<br>of the
                                        fluid core. Calculation shows that very little additional<br>energy needs to be
                                        added in the case of
                                        the earth; and the<br>necessary energy for core motion, probably in the form
                                        of<br>convection, could
                                        come from many sources.<br>
                                        <br>Thus a current is somehow started in the Earth's
                                        core, and
                                        this<br>current produces a magnetic field. &nbsp;The conducting core
                                        moves<br>through the magnetic
                                        field, and a current is induced in this<br>part of the core, starting the whole
                                        process
                                        over.<br>
                                        <br>In a stationary earth, the movements of the core would
                                        probably<br>be more or less
                                        random and the magnetic fields produced would<br>probably cancel each other. The
                                        rotation of the
                                        earth tends to<br>orient the motions of the core so that the motions
                                        and,<br>therefore, the currents
                                        are in planes perpendicular to the<br>rotational axis, Viewed<br>from outside
                                        the earth, the overall
                                        current produced would<br>be parallel to latitudes. Such currents produce a
                                        dipole<br>magnetic field
                                        red on the rotational axis.<br>
                                        <br>A field produced in this way would have all
                                        of
                                        the<br>characteristics of the Earth's magnetic field. The main field<br>would be
                                        a dipole field;
                                        superimposed on this would be other<br>fields caused by variations in the core's
                                        motion. This
                                        can<br>account for the variations in intensity and location of the<br>Earth's
                                        field. The Earth's
                                        dipole field does not coincide<br>with its rotational axis, however, as this
                                        theory
                                        predicts,<br>although if averaged over a long enough period, the dipole<br>field
                                        would perhaps
                                        appear centered on the rotational axis.<br>The positions of the magnetic pole
                                        deduced from
                                        remanent<br>magnetism of Pleistocene and younger rocks cluster around<br>the
                                        rotational axis,
                                        suggesting that this is true. The<br>present [in 1969] dipole field is 11.5
                                        degrees from
                                        the<br>rotational axis and lies northwest of Greenland, some<br>distance from
                                        the magnetic north
                                        pole, north of Canada.<br>

                                        believed, until the Mariner 10 Space<br>Craft proved them wrong, that Mercury
                                        could not have<br>a
                                        magnetic field, because it revolved too slowly.<br>They thought until about 1965
                                        that one side
                                        of<br>Mercury always faced the Sun. Actually, Mercury<br>revolves around the Sun
                                        every 88 days, and
                                        rotates<br>once every 58.6 days. It rotates three times, while<br>orbiting twice
                                        around the
                                        Sun.<br>

                                        Mariner 10 spacecraft revealed that Mercury has a<br>magnetic field with an
                                        intensity of only about
                                        1/100 that of<br>the Earth, with north and south poles closely aligned
                                        with<br>the rotational axis.
                                        This discovery was not anticipated because<br>it was considered that Mercury's

                                        rotation would<br>preclude the operation of a geomagnetic dynamo similar to
                                        the<br>Earth's. As

                                        <br>Later, when the

                                        Field began to<br>materialize that point become the North Magnetic Pole.<br>This

                                        Earth, which were the
                                        closest, and the<br>furthest, from the Sun.<br>
                                        <br>Once the Earth started to
                                        spin, most of the
                                        electrical<br>rain descended, like the Sun's life-sustaining rays,<br>on the

                                        Very little to none reach<br>the North or South Rotational Axis Poles.
                                        Therefore,<br>the receptive
                                        areas in the equatorial region began<br>to bleed off their charges to those
                                        areas that
                                        were<br>closer to the Rotational Axis Poles. Soon energy from<br>the equatorial
                                        regions, around the
                                        World began to<br>migrate toward the Rotational Axis Poles. Once aid<br>flow of
                                        energy became
                                        established, it redirected the<br>Earth's Magnetic Field, aligning it
                                        with<br>the Earth's Rotational
                                        Axis.<br>
                                        <br>Why the North Rotational Axis Pole, also became the<br>North
                                        Magnetic Pole is a little
                                        harder to explain.<br>With all things being equal, the South Rotational<br>Axis
                                        Pole had a
                                        fifty-fifty chance of becoming the<br>North Magnetic Pole. There are those who
                                        claim that<br>the
                                        North and South Rotational Axis Poles divide up<br>the honor of hosting the
                                        North Magnetic Pole.
                                        They<br>maintain that the positive and negative magnetic<br>poles, switch places
                                        periodically, kind
                                        of similar<br>to alternating current.<br>
                                        <br>As previously addressed, the theory
                                        of the
                                        poles<br>switching, more than a hundred times, sounds like a<br>vacuous
                                        deduction, to me. It was
                                        made up by the same<br>people that deduced the continents on this Earth
                                        are<br>floating around like

                                        <br>It does appear that the North Magnetic Pole
                                        could<br>be at/near
                                        the North Rotational Axis Pole, just by<br>chance. It is also possible that
                                        because of the
                                        larger<br>landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere, it attracted<br>more electrical
                                        energy than the
                                        Southern Hemisphere,<br>and therefore, became sated and began to emit
                                        energy<br>back into the jet
                                        stream, first.<br>
                                        <br>Once the flow of electrical energy from the

                                        energy south of the Equator<br>would have followed, and set the stage to
                                        redirect<br>the Earth's
                                        Magnetic Field, and align it with the<br>Northern Axis Pole.<br>
                                        <br>Whether the
                                        Earth's Magnetic
                                        Field maintained its<br>integrity, while it rotated ninety degrees to
                                        align<br>with the Earth's
                                        Rotational Poles, or was<br>extinguished when the Earth suddenly started to
                                        spin,<br>and
                                        regenerated, and aligned with the Rotational<br>Poles, is a real poser.
                                        Whichever scenario is
                                        true,<br>the realignment undoubtedly took place in a month or<br>so, likely in
                                        matter of days. On a
                                        geological time<br>scale, that is a blink of an eye. Not nearly time<br>enough,
                                        to expect that any
                                        appreciable evidences<br>would ever be found under normal circumstances,
                                        to<br>shed any light on the
                                        event. But the Dinosaur Era<br>ended during the most catastrophic event
                                        the<br>continents on this
                                        Earth have ever suffered, so<br>there may be some evidence surface indicating
                                        how<br>the Earth's
                                        Magnetic Field reacted during these<br>violent times. There is no doubt that
                                        erupting<br>volcanoes,
                                        magma flows and many horrific earthquakes<br>marked the time.<br>

                                        to<br>the region. Centrifugal force contributed somewhere<br>close to another 45
                                        feet, (15 meters)
                                        of water<br>to the equatorial regions.<br>
                                        <br>Simply put, water like the
                                        aforementioned man,
                                        weighed<br>less at the Equator than at the poles, and rose<br>proportionately to
                                        compensate for the
                                        waters that grew<br>heavier toward the Axial Poles. Diminishing, flood<br>and
                                        ebb tides continued to
                                        ravage the Earth's coasts<br>for a week after the emce phenomenon. A short
                                        time<br>compared to the
                                        atmosphere, which failed to accelerate<br>sufficiently to obtain any real
                                        stability for
                                        months.<br>
                                        <br>For the first week following the Moons passing, east<br>winds far
                                        in excess of a
                                        hundred miles per hour buffeted<br>the whole equatorial region. The lower
                                        atmosphere took<br>months
                                        to accelerate sufficiently, for the winds to<br>establish any semblance of wind
                                        patterns,
                                        similar<br>to those we have today.<br>
                                        <br>Ten years after the Moon's first pass
                                        by Earth, as
                                        it<br>passed perigee it was still creating tides two or three<br>times as
                                        formidable as any suffered
                                        on Earth today. On<br>the up side a full moon during a perigee,
                                        obliterated<br>the stars from the
                                        night skies and illuminated the<br>night nearly as light as day. A hundred years
                                        after<br>emce, at a
                                        perigee, the Moon probably only appeared<br>twice as large, than it does
                                        presently. The more
                                        oval<br>the Moon's orbit was, the quicker it stabilized<br>into a more circular
                                        orbit.<br>
                                        <br>For
                                        example, most of the change that occurred in the<br>Moon's orbit during the
                                        first ten years,
                                        actually took<br>place in the first year, of that ten-year period. Like<br>wise,
                                        most of the change
                                        in the Moon's orbit which<br>occurred in the first hundred years, took place
                                        during<br>the first ten
                                        years of &nbsp;that period, and so on. A<br>thousand years after emce, the Moon,
                                        at its
                                        perigee,<br>likely only appeared to be a couple times larger,<br>than our
                                        Harvest Moon does now on a
                                        clear night.<br>
                                        <br>The centrifugal force generated by the whirling<br>Earth
                                        after emce, threw our
                                        world drastically out<br>of kinetic balance, and instigated many untenable
                                        pressure<br>changes on
                                        the Earth's crust. Indubitably, such a sudden,<br>drastic, geological adjustment
                                        triggered
                                        innumerable<br>earthquakes, and brought on a rash of volcanic
                                        activity.<br>
                                        <br>Instability of the
                                        Earth's crust was further heightened, and<br>prolonged for many years, as the
                                        Glacier Girdle melted,
                                        and the<br>coasts of the Pacific Ocean, released from the burden of
                                        the<br>glaciers great weight,
                                        began to decompress, began to rebound.<br>It is a bit hard to comprehend how
                                        much solid rock can
                                        be<br>compressed, and rebound, when subjected to and then released<br>from a
                                        great weight. &nbsp;For
                                        example, the land around the great<br>lakes is still rebounding, rising, from
                                        the compression
                                        it<br>underwent, during the last Ice age.<br>
                                        <br>Comparatively speaking, since
                                        the Glacier Girdle
                                        began melting,<br>we could guess that the compressed rock under it has
                                        probably<br>expanded hundreds
                                        of feet. But there is little data available<br>to support such a hypothesis.
                                        Gravity tests do
                                        confirm that<br>the area under the Ring-of-Fire, the area which was under<br>the
                                        Glacier Girdle, is
                                        still heavier, is still more compressed,<br>than the strata in the adjacent
                                        areas. We do know that
                                        areas,<br>such as the Great Lakes area, do rebound after being<br>compressed
                                        with
                                        glaciers.<br>
                                        <br>But our knowledge of how much, or how quickly rock
                                        formations<br>will compress, or
                                        rebound, is very scant. Different types<br>of rock formations probably compress
                                        and rebound,
                                        at<br>different rates, and in varying degrees. For now, just<br>saying the
                                        formations once covered
                                        and compressed by the<br>Glacier Girdle, have rebounded a significant amount,
                                        and<br>are still
                                        expanding is about all we dare declare.<br>
                                        <br>Actually a phenomenon of much
                                        greater consequence
                                        than the<br>strata under the Glacier Girdle decompressing was initiated<br>when
                                        the edges of the
                                        crustal plates, which had been tilted<br>down by the awesome weight of the

                                        to<br>rise, to level. The edges, of both the oceanic and<br>continental crustal

                                        so<br>called, 'Ring-of-Fire.'
                                        Proof that crustal plates move, tilt<br>very slowly, lies in the fact that the

                                        and<br>cleared sufficiently,
                                        to enable the Sun to commence thawing<br>the Glacier Girdle. As the Glacier
                                        Girdle melted, the edges

                                        gravity began to slowly re-level<br>the plates and the aforementioned edges have

                                        also responsible for

                                        <br>Before man made his first trip to the
                                        Moon, scientists
                                        estimated<br>that the astronauts would find the Moon carpeted with from 6<br>to
                                        15 feet [2 to 5
                                        meters] of dust. They of course, made that <br soft="">assumption assuming that
                                        the Moon had been a
                                        companion of<br>Earth for the last four or five billion years.<br>
                                        <br>According
                                        to our best
                                        radiometric tests, the Moon has been<br>around somewhere, and most likely
                                        somewhere in our Solar
                                        System,<br>for at least close to four billion years. That is time enough<br>to
                                        gather a lot of dust,
                                        dust that for the most part blew off<br>of the Moon, during emce. This Moon dust
                                        is what is
                                        responsible<br>for the thin layer of iridium rich dust deposited at the<br>K-T

                                        equatorial regions.<br>

                                        Girdle<br>lasted a great
                                        deal longer, lingering for hundreds of<br>years. And undoubtedly, would have
                                        lasted even
                                        longer,<br>perhaps thousands of years in the northern regions, had<br>it not be

                                        <br>Many land animals
                                        survived emce, and lingered for years,<br>only to slowly die off, and become
                                        extinct,
                                        simply<br>because they failed to discover a niche, in which they<br>could
                                        prosper. And/or because
                                        they could not adapt<br>sufficiently, or evolve quickly enough to make
                                        them<br>selves a place on the
                                        startling new World they now<br>faced. Those animals, which did survive,
                                        underwent an<br>extended
                                        period of accelerated evolution that stocked<br>our Earth with a wide variety of
                                        strange new
                                        animals,<br>which differed mightily from their predecessors. If<br>you could
                                        totally objectively
                                        examine a randomly<br>selected group of land animal fossils that lived
                                        before<br>emce, and a similar
                                        group of fossils that lived since<br>emce, you might, mistakenly, determine that
                                        you
                                        were<br>examining fossils from two different worlds.<br>
                                        <br>Scientists have
                                        never even addressed,
                                        let alone explain,<br>what could have so thoroughly redirected the course
                                        of<br>evolution. There is
                                        one indubitable fact: No little bump<br>in the side, or even an ice age on
                                        Earth, could
                                        have<br>possibly so radically redirected evolution. Only a<br>dramatic,
                                        permanent change in the
                                        Earth's environment<br>could have instigated such an abrupt, permanent
                                        change<br>in the course of
                                        evolution.<br>
                                        <br>In the Temperate Zones, sections of the Glacier

                                        <br>Marine species fared no
                                        better during emce than<br>land animals. Like some land animals, quite a few
                                        marine<br>species may
                                        have survived for some time, perhaps even<br>scores of years, while their
                                        numbers steadily
                                        dwindled,<br>before their species finally became extinct. During<br>the emce,
                                        and during the next
                                        couple or three years that<br>it took for the atmosphere to stabilize
                                        sufficiently<br>to maintain
                                        permanently warm Edens along the equator,<br>nearly 90% of all marine species
                                        became
                                        extinct.<br>
                                        <br>Which is quite comparable to about 85% of the land<br>animal
                                        species that became
                                        extinct, during the same<br>period. In the end, a total of about 15% of the
                                        marine<br>families, and
                                        25% of all land animal families were<br>completely exterminated. Scientists
                                        claimed for
                                        many<br>years, that no animal over thirty pounds survived<br>the 'comet' that
                                        supposedly happened
                                        here on Earth.<br>They have fudged a little during the last ten years<br>or
                                        fifteen years and now,
                                        most scientists believe<br>that the largest animals that survived the K-T
                                        event<br>weighed around
                                        fifty pound.<br>
                                        <br>When we think of extinctions, the awe
                                        inspiring<br>dinosaurs, &nbsp;and perhaps
                                        those ancient horrifying<br>monsters of the depths that shared their
                                        world,<br>usually are the first
                                        creatures that light up our<br>minds. But the emce also exterminated about half
                                        the<br>groups of
                                        tiny Cretaceous plankton, as well as many<br>families of snails, sponges,
                                        bivalves, bony fishes
                                        and<br>some families of mammals and birds. And that only names<br>some of the
                                        faunas [animal
                                        life]that become extinct.<br>
                                        <br>The rest of the story is: That about half of
                                        all species<br>of land
                                        and marine floras, [plant life] also became<br>extinct during, or shortly after
                                        emce. It is
                                        highly<br>probable, that many species of the life that flourished<br>during the
                                        Cretaceous, only to
                                        became extinct due to the<br>emce phenomenon, would have survived, had the
                                        Earth<br>returned to a

                                        warm, quite salty, mineral rich, water,<br>compared to the frigid Pacific. Such
