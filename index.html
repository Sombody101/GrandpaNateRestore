                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>
                            I was born on a Wyoming Homestead on 2/21/34. Lived 90 mile from town until I was nine,
                            and
                            cowboy proud. My folks then moved to Miles City, Montana, where my schooling ended when
                            I
                            dropped out of the tenth grade. I cowboyed summers while in school, but better wages
                            soon lured
                            me into construction, then the oil field, where I found my niche. During the next 20
                            years I
                            helped drill over 100 wells in Wyoming and about 30 in the adjoining states. I spent
                            many a
                            shift out in the boondocks, studying the formations we were drilling through. And become
                            convinced of one thing: The Earth History being taught in our schools is a bunch of
                            malarkey.
                            So, upon retiring I finished a book (already started) about Earth History.

                            In 1981 the oil field collapsed, not a rig was running in Wyoming. So, I
                            went to work at the Wyoming State Penitentiary as a Steam Boiler Technician. A couple
                            years
                            later I was promoted to Boiler House Manager, and retired from that position in 1999.
                            PS: In
                            September, 2008 I bought a house in Buckeye, Arizona, 85326, to escape those cold
                            Wyoming
                            winters.
